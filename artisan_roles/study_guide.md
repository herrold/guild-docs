## Pillar Principles
* ![Not Mechanical](/img/not-mechanical.png) **_Not Mechanical_**  
   Give someone a “practice” and they can deliver for a day. Teach them a principle and they can deliver for a career.

* ![Test Driven](/img/test-driven.png) **_Test Driven_**  
   Start with the end in mind. Test driven means that before you start an activity, you know what it means to be done. We even have tests for our principles. Knowing when you are done helps people make good efficient decisions.

* ![Value Focused](/img/value-focused.png) **_Value Focused_**  
   Everyone must know “why” they are doing what they’re doing. Does it make the organization money? Does it produce valuable learning? Does it contribute to the organization’s strategy?

* ![Quality Assurance](/img/quality-assurance.png) **_Quality Assurance Mindset_**  
   Quality assurance is building quality into the product as it is being constructed. Quality control is testing the product after it has been built.

* ![Big and Visible](/img/big-visible.png) **_Big and Visible_**  
   A picture is worth a thousand words. It’s hard to ignore a wall chart. Every team should be surrounded by reminders of what real progress represents, and the problems the team is addressing.

* ![Continuous Improvement](/img/continuous-improvement.png) **_Continuous Improvement_**  
   Teams learn by doing; they create a cycle of continuous improvement -- plan / do / study / act

* ![Trust but Verify](/img/trust-verify.png) **_Trust but Verify_**  
   Team members need to work to build trust with each other as well as external stakeholders.

* ![Outcome Focused](/img/outcome-focused.png) **_Outcome Focused_**  
   There is always more than one way to solve a problem. Most “requirements” are not actually required. They just represent one way to solve the problem. Teams must always look back to the problem being solved and be flexible on which way they decide to solve it.

* ![Expect Change](/img/expect-change.png) **_Expect Change_**  
   Responding to change is more important than following a plan.

* ![Pride in Work](/img/pride-in-work.png) **_Pride in Work_**  
   Effective organizations have teams and individuals who take pride in their work. Technical team members can show pride by using software craftsmanship techniques. Leaders can demonstrate pride by creating a sustainable pace.

## Pillar Practices
* **Business Value Focus** - Are we solving a business problem or achieving a valuable opportunity? Do we have Value Stories in place?
* **Team Oriented** - bring problems to the team. There is no single “smartest person in the room”. The wisdom of the team is greater than any individual.
* **Test Driven Development** - Making change safe. Enforces simple design. Moves the chance for Production defects closer to zero.
* **Continuous Integration** - Provides fast feedback on integration issues and provides foundation for test automation and continuous deployment.
* **Pair Programming** - 2 minds on a problem, defects detected more quickly, enables a team culture of learning.
* **Drive to Continuous Deployment** - software is only valuable when in the hands of the end users. These pushes should be done as often as possible to gain feedback and to realize the value of the solution
* **Continuous Improvement** - Be aware of what is preventing the team from delivering value and break through those constraints with drive and discipline. Create fast feedback loops, information radiators and use the data to make the team better in some way every Sprint
* **Execute with discipline and excellence** - The team should have a consistent cadence, meet their commitments and make the data around their performance and progress Big & Visible
* **Own the Brand Experience** - Work with your Team's Delivery Lead, your team members, and Account Amigos to ensure that we are owning the Pillar Brand Experience that the client is receiving.  If we are not doing this, then we are not working to ensure that the engagement remains the kind of Pillar-like experience that we want to be a part of and that we want the client to receive.

## Five Questions
  These are the 5 questions everyone should be able to answer about a client:  

* What's the business benefit of what we are doing? (The Value Story)
* What is the total investment?
* How does it relate to the customer's strategy? (Who will be the consumer and how does it drive value for them?)
* When will we be done?
* How will we know we have achieved the business outcome?

## Agile Manifesto principles
1. **Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery**  
   Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases.
2. **Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process**  
   The ability to avoid delays when a requirement or feature request changes.
3. **Frequent delivery of working software**  
   Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.
4. **Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project**  
   Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned.
5. **Support, trust, and motivate the people involved**  
   Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams.
6. **Enable face-to-face interactions**  
   Communication is more successful when development teams are co-located.
7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress**  
   Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.
8. **Agile processes to support a consistent development pace**  
   Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.
9. **Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility** – The right skills and good design ensures the team can maintain the pace, constantly improve the product, and sustain change.
10. **Simplicity**  
   Develop just enough to get the job done for right now.
11. **Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs**  
   Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.
12. **Regular reflections on how to become more effective**  
   Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques help team members work more efficiently.
