## Pillar Principles
* ![Not Mechanical](/img/not-mechanical.png) **_Not Mechanical_**  
   Give someone a “practice” and they can deliver for a day. Teach them a principle and they can deliver for a career.

* ![Test Driven](/img/test-driven.png) **_Test Driven_**  
   Start with the end in mind. Test driven means that before you start an activity, you know what it means to be done. We even have tests for our principles. Knowing when you are done helps people make good efficient decisions.

* ![Value Focused](/img/value-focused.png) **_Value Focused_**  
   Everyone must know “why” they are doing what they’re doing. Does it make the organization money? Does it produce valuable learning? Does it contribute to the organization’s strategy?

* ![Quality Assurance](/img/quality-assurance.png) **_Quality Assurance Mindset_**  
   Quality assurance is building quality into the product as it is being constructed. Quality control is testing the product after it has been built.

* ![Big and Visible](/img/big-visible.png) **_Big and Visible_**  
   A picture is worth a thousand words. It’s hard to ignore a wall chart. Every team should be surrounded by reminders of what real progress represents, and the problems the team is addressing.

* ![Continuous Improvement](/img/continuous-improvement.png) **_Continuous Improvement_**  
   Teams learn by doing; they create a cycle of continuous improvement -- plan / do / study / act

* ![Trust but Verify](/img/trust-verify.png) **_Trust but Verify_**  
   Team members need to work to build trust with each other as well as external stakeholders.

* ![Outcome Focused](/img/outcome-focused.png) **_Outcome Focused_**  
   There is always more than one way to solve a problem. Most “requirements” are not actually required. They just represent one way to solve the problem. Teams must always look back to the problem being solved and be flexible on which way they decide to solve it.

* ![Expect Change](/img/expect-change.png) **_Expect Change_**  
   Responding to change is more important than following a plan.

* ![Pride in Work](/img/pride-in-work.png) **_Pride in Work_**  
   Effective organizations have teams and individuals who take pride in their work. Technical team members can show pride by using software craftsmanship techniques. Leaders can demonstrate pride by creating a sustainable pace.

## Pillar Practices
* **Business Value Focus** - Are we solving a business problem or achieving a valuable opportunity? Do we have Value Stories in place?
* **Team Oriented** - bring problems to the team. There is no single “smartest person in the room”. The wisdom of the team is greater than any individual.
* **Test Driven Development** - Making change safe. Enforces simple design. Moves the chance for Production defects closer to zero.
* **Continuous Integration** - Provides fast feedback on integration issues and provides foundation for test automation and continuous deployment.
* **Pair Programming** - 2 minds on a problem, defects detected more quickly, enables a team culture of learning.
* **Drive to Continuous Deployment** - software is only valuable when in the hands of the end users. These pushes should be done as often as possible to gain feedback and to realize the value of the solution
* **Continuous Improvement** - Be aware of what is preventing the team from delivering value and break through those constraints with drive and discipline. Create fast feedback loops, information radiators and use the data to make the team better in some way every Sprint
* **Execute with discipline and excellence** - The team should have a consistent cadence, meet their commitments and make the data around their performance and progress Big & Visible
* **Own the Brand Experience** - Work with your Team's Delivery Lead, your team members, and Account Amigos to ensure that we are owning the Pillar Brand Experience that the client is receiving.  If we are not doing this, then we are not working to ensure that the engagement remains the kind of Pillar-like experience that we want to be a part of and that we want the client to receive.

## Five Questions
  These are the 5 questions everyone should be able to answer about a client:  

* What's the business benefit of what we are doing? (The Value Story)
* What is the total investment?
* How does it relate to the customer's strategy? (Who will be the consumer and how does it drive value for them?)
* When will we be done?
* How will we know we have achieved the business outcome?

## Agile Manifesto principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
