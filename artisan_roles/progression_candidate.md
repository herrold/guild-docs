title: Being a Candidate for Progression
---

> Please note that the path for progression is something that will continue to evolve over time as we receive feedback, gain additional experience, and grow as a company.

---

## What is the purpose for this process?
*(AKA: Why can't someone simply anoint me as the next Guild Persona?)*

The purpose is to provide you with appropriate feedback and guidance to assist you with your professional growth and development.  In combination with other feedback mechanisms already in place (e.g. Career Retros), the account and regional artisans, along with team craftsmen, help ensure that feedback and mentoring will be available to everyone within the company.

## What is a Candidate for Progression?
A Candidate for Progression is an Artisan who has:

* Demonstrated that he or she is ready for consideration to be moved to the next Guild Persona
* Is being sponsored for candidacy by a Craftsman who is working closely with the Candidate

## How do I become a Candidate for Progression?
Pillar Craftsmen will be continually on the lookout for people who are ready to become candidates for progression and will arrange for sponsorship.  Alternatively, you can find your own sponsor among the craftsmen on your team.

You'll need a Sponsor who will act as your advocate during the process. Your sponsor will give you feedback regarding your readiness for progression. Your sponsor may give you action items to work on before scheduling a conversation with another Craftsman.

---

## Why do I need a Sponsor?
A Sponsor will go through all the material on this website with you and help you generate a one or two page summary document stating how you meet the qualifications of the next Guild Persona.

During the writing of the summary document, areas for further work might be identified. Work with you Sponsor to create a list of action items and a time to review your progress in these areas.

A Sponsor's primary purpose is to be an advocate; someone "by your side" at the progression conversations.  Your Sponsor will help lay out specifics of your eligibility for progression.

Sponsors also act as a preliminary "screening". Your Sponsor must consider you ready for progression before proceeding, so this is an effective way of getting quick feedback (and endorsement!) before moving further in the process.

## Role Advancement Processes

### Apprentice to Journeyman, and Journeyman to Craftsman

Each of the following steps are required.

1. Gain sponsorship from a Craftsman who has worked with you
2. Review all the pages on this web site
2. Create a one or two page document summarizing how you have met the next Guild Persona requirements. Do this with your Sponsor so that you can receive feedback about steps for improvement
3. When your Sponsor agrees that you are ready for progression, they will arrange for another Craftsman who knows you (preferably someone outside your current team) to meet with the two of you. The outcome of that meeting will be one of the following:
  * You will be given a list of action items to work on over a specified period of time (3/6/12 months);
  * You will be approved to go meet with the next group of individuals.
4. Repeat step 3 until you receive approval.
  * If you disagree with the outcome of your meeting with your Sponsor and the other Craftsman, you can reach out to your Account Artisan or Regional Artisan.
5. You and your sponsor will meet with the Account Artisan (if one exists), the Regional Artisan(s) and the Regional Learning Champion for Craftsmanship. The result of this meeting is either craftsman recognition or action items.
5. If the result of your meeting is you're ready, then the Regional Artisan will work with Delivery to determine when this move can happen.
***Please note that, based on various factors, an immediate move is not always possible.***
6. After final approvals have been obtained, you will receive a letter acknowledging your new Persona.  Only then will the candidacy for progression be completed.

## What if I have concerns over how my Candidacy for Progression is being handled?
If you have concerns over how your Candidacy for Progression is being handled, please follow the below escalation process.  Note that attempting to jump ahead in the escalation process is only going to result in all of the previous conversations happening anyway, so there is nothing to be gained by ignoring the escalation process.

1. Your first point of escalation is your Account Artisan.  You should start by explaining to him/her your situation and concerns.
2. If you feel that your concerns have not been addressed by your Account Artisan, the second point of escalation is Regional Artisan.
3. If you still feel that your concerns have not been addressed, your third point of escalation is the regional learning champion for craftsmanship.
4. If nothing has addressed your concerns by this point, please escalate to HR, so they can help facilitate the necessary conversations to understand what the situation is from everyone's perspectives.
